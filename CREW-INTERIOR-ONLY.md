## 📊 Before vs After

## 🔮 Future Considerations

If you need to add other departments later:

1. **Edit** `backend/prisma/seed.ts`
2. **Add** crew members with appropriate departments
3. **Run** `reset-and-seed.bat`
4. **Update** permissions if needed

**Example:**
```typescript
// If you need Deck crew in future
{ name: 'Captain Name', position: 'Captain', department: 'Deck', status: 'active', email: 'captain@yacht.local', role: 'admin' },
```

- **Stewardesses handle service requests:** This is their core responsibility
- **Simplified management:** Easier to manage one focused department
- **Professional approach:** Real yachts have specialized Interior teams
- **Scalable:** Easy to add other departments if needed later
