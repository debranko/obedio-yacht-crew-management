# Backend API Progress Report

## 🎉 Major Accomplishments

### Database Foundation ✅
Successfully created 5 new critical database tables:
1. **Message** - Crew messaging/chat system
2. **NotificationSettings** - User notification preferences  
3. **ServiceRequestHistory** - Track all service request changes
4. **CrewChangeLog** - Audit trail for crew management
5. **RolePermissions** - Role-based access control

### API Endpoints Created ✅
1. **Role Permissions API** (`/api/permissions`)
   - Get/update permissions by role
   - Admin-only permission management
   - Default permissions initialization

2. **Notification Settings API** (`/api/notification-settings`)
   - Get/update user notification preferences
   - Push token management
   - Test notification endpoint

3. **Messages/Chat API** (`/api/messages`)
   - Full messaging CRUD operations
   - Conversation threads
   - Unread count tracking
   - WebSocket integration for real-time

### Code Quality Improvements ✅
- Fixed all port configurations (3001 → 8080)
- Removed mock data imports from AppDataContext
- Replaced simulateNewServiceRequest with clean implementation
- Regenerated Prisma client with new models

## 📊 Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ All existing APIs (crew, guests, locations, service requests, devices)
- ✅ Authentication & authorization
- ✅ WebSocket real-time events
- ✅ Database migrations applied
- ✅ New foundation tables created

### What Needs Work
- 🚧 Settings page needs to connect to new APIs
- 🚧 Activity Log only Devices tab uses backend
- 🚧 Dashboard has no save functionality
- 🚧 Device Manager UI not implemented
- 🚧 Service Requests still using local state for some operations

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Connect Frontend to New APIs
- Update Settings page to use notification settings API
- Update Settings page to use role permissions API
- Add messages/chat UI component

### 2. Create Remaining Backend APIs
- Service Request History tracking
- Crew Change Logs
- Activity Logs (connect existing endpoints)
- Dashboard Layouts

### 3. Fix Critical Issues
- Activity Log - connect all tabs to backend
- Dashboard - implement save/load functionality
- Service Requests - replace context with API mutations

## 🔧 Technical Debt to Address

### Backend
- Add input validation middleware
- Implement rate limiting
- Add pagination to all list endpoints
- Create proper error handling
- Remove console.log statements

### Frontend
- Replace all mock data usage
- Add loading states to all pages
- Implement error boundaries
- Add retry logic for failed requests

## 📈 Progress Metrics

- **Database Tables**: 16/16 created ✅
- **Core API Endpoints**: 14/20 implemented (70%)
- **Frontend Integration**: 8/14 pages fully connected (57%)
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket base ready, needs event standardization

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The following new features are ready to test:
1. Role-based permissions system
2. Notification settings
3. Messaging system (backend ready, needs UI)

## 📝 Notes

- Server is running on port 8080
- All new tables have been migrated successfully
- Prisma client has been regenerated
- No data loss - all existing functionality preserved
