# ✅ MQTT Frontend Restart Complete!

## Next Steps:

### 1. Open Browser Console
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Look in the **Console** tab

### 2. What You Should See:
```
🔧 MQTT connect() called
📍 Environment variables check:
  - VITE_MQTT_BROKER: ws://localhost:9001
  - Using broker URL: ws://localhost:9001
✅ MQTT connected successfully from frontend
✅ Button Simulator: MQTT connected successfully
```

### 3. Test the Button
1. In the ESP32 Simulator (left sidebar)
2. Select "Lazzaret" from dropdown
3. Click the main button (center gold button)
4. Watch the console for: `📤 MQTT published to obedio/button/...`

### 4. Check MQTT Monitor
1. Open http://localhost:8888 
2. You should see:
   - Device connected in left panel
   - Message appear when button pressed

### 5. Check Backend Logs
In the terminal running the backend, look for:
```
📨 MQTT: Button press received
✅ Service request created from MQTT
```

## If MQTT Still Not Working:

Check browser console for errors like:
- "WebSocket connection failed"
- "net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

This would mean the MQTT broker isn't running properly.

## Success Indicators:
✅ No console errors about MQTT
✅ "MQTT connected successfully" message
✅ Button presses create service requests
✅ MQTT Monitor shows messages
