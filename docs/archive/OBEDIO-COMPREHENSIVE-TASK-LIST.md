# OBEDIO Yacht Crew Management System - Comprehensive Task List

## Executive Summary

After a thorough code review of the entire OBEDIO application, I've identified 90 tasks that need to be completed to make this a fully functional production-ready server application. The system is designed to manage crew and guest service requests on luxury yachts with ESP32 hardware integration, mobile apps, and real-time communication.

**Current State**: The frontend UI is mostly complete, but many features are using mock data or are not connected to backend APIs. The backend has basic functionality but is missing many critical endpoints and integrations.

## Priority Classification

## Technical Debt

1. **No Tests**: The application has zero tests. This is critical for a production system.
2. **No Error Boundaries**: Limited error handling throughout the application.
3. **No Logging**: Minimal logging for debugging production issues.
4. **No Monitoring**: No APM or error tracking setup.
5. **No CI/CD**: Manual deployment process.

## Conclusion

The OBEDIO system has a solid foundation with a well-designed UI and basic backend structure. However, significant work remains to make it production-ready. The highest priority should be completing the backend APIs, implementing real-time communication (MQTT/WebSocket), and removing all mock data. Once these core features are stable, focus can shift to hardware integration and mobile app development.

**Estimated Total Development Time**: 12-16 weeks for a small team (2-3 developers)

**Recommended Team Structure**:
- 1 Backend Developer (Node.js, PostgreSQL, MQTT)
- 1 Frontend Developer (React, TypeScript)
- 1 Hardware/Firmware Engineer (ESP32, C++)
- 1 Mobile Developer (iOS/Android) - can join later
