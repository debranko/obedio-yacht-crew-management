## üéØ Purpose

This guide explains **how to navigate and use** the Obedio architecture documentation to understand the system, contribute code, and solve problems.

## üìñ Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into **focused, modular files** so you don't have to read everything at once.

```

## üöÄ Quick Start Paths

### **Path 1: "I just joined the project"**

**Goal:** Understand what Obedio is and how it works

**Read in this order:**
1. `docs/README.md` (5 min) - Overview
2. `docs/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` (30 min) - Architecture
3. `docs/TASK-STATUS.md` (10 min) - Current state
4. Root `README.md` (10 min) - Setup instructions

**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Result:** You understand the system and can run it locally

---

### **Path 2: "I'm a backend developer"**

**Goal:** Work on API endpoints and database

**Read in this order:**
1. `docs/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` - Get the big picture
2. `docs/BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md` - API patterns
3. `docs/DATABASE-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Schema details
4. `docs/INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` - How frontend calls backend

**Focus Areas:**
- `backend/src/routes/` - API endpoints
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `backend/.env` - Configuration

**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Result:** Ready to create/modify API endpoints

---

### **Path 3: "I'm a frontend developer"**

**Goal:** Build UI components and connect to APIs

**Read in this order:**
1. `docs/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` - Architecture overview
2. `docs/FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md` - React patterns
3. `docs/INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` - API integration

**Focus Areas:**
- `src/components/pages/` - Page components

- `src/services/` - API clients

**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Result:** Ready to build/modify UI features

---

### **Path 4: "I need to fix a bug"**

**Goal:** Understand where to look and what to change

**Steps:**
1. **Identify the layer:**
   - UI bug? ‚Üí Read `FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - API error? ‚Üí Read `BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Data issue? ‚Üí Read `DATABASE-ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Connection problem? ‚Üí Read `INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`

2. **Find the relevant file:**
   - Use the folder structure diagrams in each doc
   - Search for component/route/table name

3. **Understand the pattern:**
   - Follow the existing code pattern
   - Check similar working features

4. **Test the fix:**
   - Follow testing sections in docs
   - Verify no regressions

**Time:** 10-30 min to locate + time to fix  
**Result:** Targeted bug fix with minimal side effects

---

### **Path 5: "I want to add a new feature"**

**Goal:** Understand the full stack and add feature properly

**Steps:**
1. **Read** `docs/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` - Understand architecture layers
2. **Plan** which layers you'll touch:
   - Database? ‚Üí Create migration
   - Backend? ‚Üí Add route + service
   - Frontend? ‚Üí Add component + hook
   - Real-time? ‚Üí Add WebSocket event

3. **Read** relevant architecture docs for each layer
4. **Follow** the patterns shown in docs
5. **Test** each layer independently
6. **Integrate** and test end-to-end

**Time:** 2-4 hours depending on feature complexity  
**Result:** Feature implemented following best practices

---

### **Path 6: "I'm a project manager/stakeholder"**

**Goal:** Understand what's built and what's pending

**Read in this order:**
1. `docs/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` (focus on "What is Obedio?" section)
2. `docs/TASK-STATUS.md` - See progress
3. `METSTRADE-2025-ROADMAP.md` - Timeline

**Time:** 20 min  
**Result:** Clear understanding of project status

## üí° Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Use the diagrams**

Every architecture doc has **ASCII diagrams** showing:
- Data flow
- Component relationships
- Architecture layers

**These are gold!** Refer to them when confused.

---

### **Tip 2: Follow the "Expected Outcome" sections**

Many docs include:
```
Expected Outcome:
- Before: [problem]
- After: [solution]
```

These help you understand **why** things are built the way they are.

---

### **Tip 3: Check code examples**

All docs include **real code snippets** from the project.  
These show:
- Naming conventions
- Coding patterns
- Best practices

**Copy these patterns** when adding new code.

---

### **Tip 4: Use the troubleshooting sections**

Each doc has a **"Troubleshooting"** section at the end.

Check these **before** asking for help. Most common issues are already documented.

---

### **Tip 5: Cross-reference between docs**

Docs link to each other. Example:
- `FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md` says "See INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md for API details"
- `BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md` says "See DATABASE-ARCHITECTURE.md for schema"

**Follow these links** for deeper understanding.

---

## üîÑ Documentation Workflow

### **When Reading Code:**
1. Open the relevant architecture doc
2. Find the folder/file in the structure diagram
3. Read the pattern explanation
4. Refer back to code with new understanding

### **When Writing Code:**
1. Read the architecture doc for that layer
2. Find a similar existing feature
3. Follow the same pattern
4. Test thoroughly

### **When Reviewing Code:**
1. Check if it follows patterns in docs
2. Verify naming conventions
3. Ensure tests match the patterns

---

## üìù Keeping Docs Updated

### **If you add a new feature:**
- Update the relevant architecture doc
- Add the file to the folder structure diagram
- Explain the pattern you used

### **If you find outdated info:**
- Create an issue or PR
- Mark the section with `‚ö†Ô∏è OUTDATED`
- Propose the correction

### **If something is unclear:**
- Add a question in the doc as a comment
- Ask the team
- Update the doc once answered

---

## üÜò Still Stuck?

### **Can't find what you're looking for?**
1. Check `docs/README.md` - The master index
2. Search files for keywords (Ctrl+F in each doc)
3. Ask the team with specific document + section reference

### **Docs are outdated?**
1. Check git commit dates at top of each file
2. Cross-reference with actual code
3. Update the doc and submit a PR

### **Need help understanding architecture?**
1. Start with `SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md`
2. Draw your own diagrams
3. Discuss with the team
