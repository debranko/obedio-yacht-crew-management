## üé¨ **DEMO SCRIPT (5 Minutes):**

### **Minute 1: Problem Statement**
"Yacht crew management is chaotic. Guests call for service via phone, intercom, or random methods. Crew can't track requests, prioritize tasks, or coordinate efficiently."

### **Minute 2: Solution Overview**
"Obedio is an intelligent butler call system with smart buttons in every cabin and public area. One press alerts crew with location, guest info, and priority level."

### **Minute 3: Live Demo - Service Request**
1. Press physical ESP32 button
2. Show dashboard lighting up with new request
3. Show notification on crew device
4. Accept request, show status update
5. Complete request, show history

### **Minute 4: Show Key Features**
- Real-time dashboard (multiple requests handling)
- Location management (yacht layout with photos)
- Guest profiles (dietary restrictions, preferences)
- Device Manager (monitor all buttons, battery levels)

### **Minute 5: Scalability & Roadmap**
- Works on yachts of any size (show 200+ locations)
- Watch apps for crew (Apple Watch, Android Wear)
- LoRa for long-range (superyachts, outdoor areas)
- Voice messages (ESP32 with microphone)
- AI predictions (anticipate guest needs)

**Call to Action:** "Book a demo installation for your yacht. First 10 sign-ups get 50% off hardware."
